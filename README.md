# AngularCourseProject

This is the project of the [Angular - The complete guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/) course, created by [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/).

It is a recipe book app that allows the user to login, load and store their recipes and use a shopping list to buy ingredients for those recipes.

It was developed throughout the course to help understand the Angular framework and its tools, such as Components, Databinding, Directives, Forms, Services, Dependency Injection, Routing, Observables, Authentication, Guards, Interceptors, Modules and more.

Its deployed version can be found in the following URL:
